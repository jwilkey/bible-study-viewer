        comment: `That's harsh! The world often behaves according to this rule, and we ourselves may often be tempted to impatiently force our will on others in this way. Even in Christian family we may be tempted to exert our preference in the guise of greater experience or title. Yet, how much sweeter to appeal to the character of Christ and the example of His light, then to see this light shine from the other of it's own working, rather than of hot glow of your pressure upon them?! Nonetheless, there are times when authority must be exerted, justice must be established.`,
