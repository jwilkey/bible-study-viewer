11˚For this is the message
               that you have heard from the beginning,
               that we should love one another.

12˚We should not be like Cain,
      who was of the evil one
      and murdered his brother.
        And why did he murder him?
        Because his own deeds were evil
        and his brother's righteous.

13˚Do not be surprised, brothers,
             that the world hates you.
14˚We know that we have passed out of death
                               into life,
      because we love the brothers.
Whoever does not love
       abides in death.
           15˚Everyone who hates his brother
                      is a murderer,
      and you know that no murderer
               has eternal life abiding in him.

16˚By this we know love,
      that he laid down his life
      for us,
      and we ought to lay down our lives
      for the brothers.
17˚But
   if anyone has the world's goods
             and sees his brother in need,
             yet closes his heart against him,
   how does God's love abide in him?

18˚Little children,
   let us not love in word
                   or talk
                   but in deed
                   and in truth.
19˚By this we shall know that we are of the truth
                and reassure our heart before him;
             20˚for whenever our heart condemns us,
         God is greater than our heart,
     and he knows everything.
21˚Beloved,
   if our heart does not condemn us,
                 we have confidence before God;
 22˚and whatever we ask
                 we receive from him,
         because we keep his commandments
                and do what pleases him.
          23˚And this is his commandment,
                 that we believe in the name of his Son
                                        Jesus Christ
                     and love one another,
              just as he has commanded us.
        24˚Whoever keeps his commandments
                   abides in God,
                         and God in him.
    And by this we know that he abides in us,
        by the Spirit whom he has given us.
