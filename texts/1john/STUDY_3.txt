1˚My little children,
I am writing these things to you
     so that you may not sin.
  But if anyone does sin,
    we have an advocate
               with the Father,
               Jesus Christ the righteous.
2˚He is the propitiation for our sins,
                 and not for ours only
                but also for the sins of the whole world.
3˚And by this we know
         that we have come to know him,
           if we keep his commandments.
  4˚Whoever says “I know him”
            but does not keep his commandments
            is a liar,
            and the truth is not in him,
5˚but
whoever keeps his word,
      in him truly the love of God is perfected.
By this we may know that we are in him:
 6˚whoever says he abides in him
           ought to walk in the same way in which he walked.

7˚Beloved,
I am writing you no new commandment,
     but an old commandment
            that you had from the beginning.
        The old commandment is the word that you have heard.
8˚At the same time,
it is a new commandment that I am writing to you,
        which is true
                 in him
                 and in you,
                 because the darkness is passing away
                 and the true light is already shining.
 9˚Whoever says he is in the light
           and hates his brother
           is still in darkness.
10˚Whoever loves his brother
           abides in the light,
           and in him there is no cause for stumbling.
11˚But
   whoever hates his brother
           is in the darkness
           and walks in the darkness,
           and does not know where he is going,
               because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
