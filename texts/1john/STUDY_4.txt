12˚I am writing to you, 
                   little children,
                   because your sins are forgiven
                   for his name's sake.
13˚I am writing to you,
                   fathers,
                   because you know him
                   who is from the beginning.
   I am writing to you,
                   young men,
                   because you have overcome the evil one.
   I write to you,
              children,
              because you know the Father.
14˚I write to you,
              fathers,
              because you know him
              who is from the beginning.
   I write to you,
              young men,
              because you are strong,
              and the word of God abides in you,
              and you have overcome the evil one.

15˚Do not love the world
               or the things in the world.
      If anyone loves the world,
            the love of the Father is not in him.
      16˚For all that is in the world—
                            the desires of the flesh
                        and the desires of the eyes
                            and pride of life—
                         is not from the Father
                         but is from the world.
      17˚And the world is passing away
                 along with its desires,
   but whoever does the will of God
               abides forever.
