|17| So
if you consider me your partner,
  receive him
  as you would receive me.
|18| If he has wronged you at all,
           or owes you anything,
  charge that to my account.
|19| I, Paul, write this with my own hand:
    I will repay itâ€”
    to say nothing of your owing me
                           even your own self.
|20| Yes, brother,
  I want some benefit from you in the Lord.
  Refresh my heart in Christ.

|21| Confident of your obedience,
    I write to you,
    knowing that you will do even more than I say.
|22| At the same time,
    prepare a guest room for me,
      for I am hoping that
        through your prayers
      I will be graciously given to you.
