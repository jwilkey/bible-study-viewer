  "text": "1ËšBeloved,\ndo not believe every spirit,\nbut test the spirits to see whether they are from God,\nfor many false prophets have gone out into the world.\n2 By this you know the Spirit of God:\nevery spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,\n3 and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God.\nThis is the spirit of the antichrist,\nwhich you heard was coming and now is in the world already.\n4 Little children,\nyou are from God and have overcome them,\nfor he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.\n5 They are from the world;\ntherefore they speak from the world,\nand the world listens to them.\n6 We are from God.\nWhoever knows God listens to us;\nwhoever is not from God does not listen to us.\nBy this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error.",
