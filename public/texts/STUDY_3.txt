|8| Accordingly,
though I am bold enough
    in Christ
    to command you
       to do what is required,
|9| yet for love's sake
    I prefer to appeal to you—
I, Paul, an old man
         and now a prisoner also
         for Christ Jesus—
|10| I appeal to you for my child, Onesimus,
    whose father I became
      in my imprisonment.
|11| (Formerly he was useless to you,
    but now he is indeed useful to you
        and to me.)
|12| I am sending him back to you,
        sending my very heart.
|13| I would have been glad to keep him with me,
    in order that he might serve me
                  on your behalf
                  during my imprisonment for the gospel,
|14| but
  I preferred to do nothing without your consent
    in order that your goodness might not be by compulsion
    but of your own accord.
|15| For this perhaps is why he was parted from you for a while,
    that you might have him back forever,
    |16| no longer as a bondservant
      but more than a bondservant,
    as a beloved brother—
        especially to me,
        but how much more to you,
    both in the flesh
     and in the Lord.
