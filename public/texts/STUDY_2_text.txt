|4| I thank my God
    always
    when I remember you in my prayers,
|5| because I hear of your love
    and of the faith that you have
        toward the Lord Jesus
        and for all the saints,
|6| and I pray
    that the sharing of your faith may become effective
        for the full knowledge of
            every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ.
|7| For I have derived much joy
                      and comfort
             from your love, my brother,
    because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed
        through you.
