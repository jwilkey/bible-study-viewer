1˚See what kind of love the Father has given to us,
      that we should be called children of God;
                               and so we are.
The reason why the world does not know us
    is that it did not know him.

2˚Beloved,
  we are God's children now,
            and what we will be has not yet appeared;
  but we know that when he appears
                   we shall be like him,
                   because we shall see him
                                    as he is.
         3˚And everyone who thus hopes in him
                                 purifies himself
                                 as he is pure.

4˚Everyone who makes a practice of sinning
                  also practices lawlessness;
                          sin is lawlessness.
5˚You know that he appeared
                in order to take away sins,
                and in him there is no sin.
              6˚No one who abides in him
                           keeps on sinning;
                no one who keeps on sinning
                           has either seen him
                           or known him.
7˚Little children,
  let no one deceive you.
  Whoever practices righteousness
                 is righteous,
           as he is righteous.
8˚Whoever makes a practice of sinning
                        is of the devil,
    for the devil has been sinning from the beginning.
The reason the Son of God appeared
    was to destroy the works of the devil.
  9˚No one born of God
           makes a practice of sinning,
           for God's seed abides in him;
           and he cannot keep on sinning,
           because he has been born of God.
 10˚By this it is evident who are the children of God,
                      and who are the children of the devil:
       whoever does not practice righteousness
                 is not of God,
       nor is the one who does not love his brother.
