  "text": "1˚See what kind of love the Father has given to us,\n      that we should be called children of God;\n                               and so we are.\nThe reason why the world does not know us\n    is that it did not know him.\n\n2˚Beloved,\n  we are God's children now,\n            and what we will be has not yet appeared;\n  but we know that when he appears\n                   we shall be like him,\n                   because we shall see him\n                                    as he is.\n         3˚And everyone who thus hopes in him\n                                 purifies himself\n                                 as he is pure.\n\n4˚Everyone who makes a practice of sinning\n                  also practices lawlessness;\n                          sin is lawlessness.\n5˚You know that he appeared\n                in order to take away sins,\n                and in him there is no sin.\n              6˚No one who abides in him\n                           keeps on sinning;\n                no one who keeps on sinning\n                           has either seen him\n                           or known him.\n7˚Little children,\n  let no one deceive you.\n  Whoever practices righteousness\n                 is righteous,\n           as he is righteous.\n8˚Whoever makes a practice of sinning\n                        is of the devil,\n    for the devil has been sinning from the beginning.\nThe reason the Son of God appeared\n    was to destroy the works of the devil.\n  9˚No one born of God\n           makes a practice of sinning,\n           for God's seed abides in him;\n           and he cannot keep on sinning,\n           because he has been born of God.\n 10˚By this it is evident who are the children of God,\n                      and who are the children of the devil:\n       whoever does not practice righteousness\n                 is not of God,\n       nor is the one who does not love his brother.",
